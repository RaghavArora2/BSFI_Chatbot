# Sample Insurance Policy Documents

This directory contains sample insurance policy documents used for demonstrating the chatbot functionality. These are simplified examples intended for educational purposes only and do not constitute actual insurance policies.

## Included Documents

1. **auto_insurance.pdf**: Sample auto insurance policy covering liability, collision, comprehensive coverage, etc.
2. **health_insurance.pdf**: Sample health insurance policy covering medical services, prescriptions, etc.
3. **home_insurance.pdf**: Sample home insurance policy covering dwelling, personal property, liability, etc.
4. **life_insurance.pdf**: Sample life insurance policy covering term and whole life options.

## Using Your Own Documents

You can replace these sample documents with your own insurance policies by:

1. Uploading them through the UI
2. Directly replacing these files with your own (using the same filenames)
3. Adding new PDF files to this directory

For best results, ensure your documents contain clear, structured information about insurance policies.

## Document Format

The chatbot works best with documents that:

1. Contain searchable text (not just scanned images)
2. Have clear headings and structure
3. Include detailed information about coverage, terms, and conditions

## Privacy Note

When using real insurance documents, be aware that they may contain sensitive personal information. Be cautious about sharing the repository or deploying the application with sensitive documents included.
